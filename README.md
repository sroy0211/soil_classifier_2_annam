🌱 Soil Classification - Part 2 Challenge – 2025 Hackathon by Annam.ai @ IIT Ropar 🌍

Welcome to my final submission for the Soil Classification - Part 2 Challenge 2025 organized by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar!

This competition focuses on a fundamental yet critical task:

Determining whether an input image represents soil or not.

Soil plays a crucial role in agriculture, climate resilience, and ecosystem health. Accurately identifying soil images in real-time can significantly aid in:

🌾 Precision agriculture

🧪 Environmental monitoring

🗺️ Land-use planning

🧠 Task Overview

The dataset contains a diverse set of images — some depicting soil, others non-soil backgrounds. The goal is to train a binary classifier that can correctly identify soil images (label: 1) from non-soil images (label: 0).

This task has real-world relevance, blending AI with sustainability, and is evaluated using the minimum F1-score across classes to ensure balanced model performance.

⚙️ Setup & Run Instructions

🚨 Before starting, make sure you have the dataset from the hackathon downloaded.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Download the dataset from the competition platform and place it inside the data/ directory.

3. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the notebook:

    Open the Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ folder

5. Update file paths in the notebook wherever necessary (e.g., when loading images or CSV files) to match your local data/ directory.

6. Execute the notebook cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and generate predictions for submission.
