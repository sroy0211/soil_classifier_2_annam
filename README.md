🌱 Soil Classification Challenge – 2025 Hackathon by Annam.ai @ IIT Ropar 🌍

Welcome to my final submission for the Soil Image Classification Challenge 2025 organized by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar!

This competition focuses on a fundamental yet critical task:

Determining whether an input image represents soil or not using computer vision and machine learning.
Soil plays a crucial role in agriculture, climate resilience, and ecosystem health. Accurately identifying soil images in real-time can significantly aid in:

🌾 Precision agriculture
🧪 Environmental monitoring
🗺️ Land-use planning
🧠 Task Overview
The dataset contains a diverse set of images — some depicting soil, others non-soil backgrounds. The goal is to train a binary classifier that can correctly identify soil images (label: 1) from non-soil images (label: 0).

This task has real-world relevance, blending AI with sustainability, and is evaluated using the minimum F1-score across classes to ensure balanced model performance.
